# Athena

Athena is an ERC20 token, which is a standardised type of smart contract that can be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. As an ERC20 token, Athena adheres to rules and functions that ensure compatibility and interoperability with other tokens and applications within the Ethereum ecosystem. This standardisation facilitates the integration of Athena into various wallets, exchanges, and decentralised applications (dApps).

## Features

- **ERC20 Standard**: Ensures compatibility and interoperability with other tokens and applications within the Ethereum ecosystem.
- **Dynamic Supply Management**: Allows the parent/owner to adjust the total supply of Athena tokens.

### Supply Management Functions

1. **reSupply**: This function enables the parent/owner to increase the total supply of Athena tokens. By invoking this function, new tokens can be minted and added to the owner’s balance, thereby increasing the overall circulation of Athena tokens in the market. This feature can be handy for responding to increased demand or distributing tokens during promotional events or rewards programs.

2. **reduceSupply**: This function allows the parent/owner to decrease the total supply of Athena tokens. By invoking this function, tokens can be burned or removed from the owner’s balance, effectively reducing the total number of tokens in circulation. This capability can combat inflation, increase scarcity, or maintain a specific value per token.

## Advantages

The ability to dynamically manage the token supply provides the owner with significant flexibility in managing the economics and utility of the Athena token. This feature distinguishes Athena from other ERC20 tokens with a fixed supply, offering a unique advantage in various strategic and financial scenarios.
